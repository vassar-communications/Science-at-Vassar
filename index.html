<p>The opening of the Integrated Science Commons in January 2016 signals the completion of Vassar&#8217;s new Integrated Science Center. To commemorate this milestone, several events and exhibitions will be launched on campus during the spring 2016 semester.</p>
<p>Many of these activities bridge different disciplines and draw from college&#8217;s rich history, and also look ahead to what the future of the sciences and arts at Vassar will hold.</p>

<p class="Module__desc__paragraph">In 1862, Matthew Vassar commissioned a cabinet, to be filled with specimens, models and materials to provide a hands-on education. In 2016, Vassar opens a new integrated science center, complete with displays telling the story of those &#8220;sources&#8221; we use in our education in science. These eight dynamic displays each tell stories of Vassar&#8217;s past and present science, united by verbs that speak to the dynamic process of science and science education. The displays comprise images, textual stories and the very sources of learning science; objects and artifacts that make science come alive.</p>

<p class="Module__desc__paragraph">Visualization methods provide an important tool in science for the analysis and presentation of scientific work. Scientific images can also transcend their role as a medium for transmitting information and contain the aesthetic qualities that transform them into objects of beauty and art. In celebration of the opening of the new Bridge for Laboratory Sciences, this is a call for images that bridge the sciences and the arts/humanities. Everyone in the Vassar Community can submit entries, and a panel of faculty, staff, and student judges will choose the best work for display. Additionally, the best student work in each of three categories will win cash prizes and be on display in the Bridge for Laboratory Sciences this spring. Sponsored by the Asprey Center for Collaborative Approaches to Science and the Creative Arts Across Disciplines Initiative (CAAD).</p>

<p class="Module__desc__paragraph">Science is often thought of solely as a discipline of the rational mind. Through the scientific method, a question is asked, a hypotheses is proposed, research pursued, and sometimes, answers found. But throughout the process, the scientist, a creative being, takes steps of intuition, fabricates and wields tools in a creative manner, and synthesizes disparate streams of thought into cohesive ends. Through the display of a portion of Vassar&#8217;s antique science equipment, juxtaposed with thoughts from modern scientists, this exhibition seeks to replicate small fragments of what it like to be a creative being in a logic driven endeavor. This will include materials that illustrate the &#8216;creative leap&#8217;, devices invented for the sole purpose of answering questions, as well as materials that will be a delight to the senses.</p>

<p class="Module__desc__paragraph">Astronomy can be traced back to antiquity with its origins in religious and mythological beliefs; its study has been closely linked to artistic endeavors since the Renaissance. <em>Touch the Sky</em> is a multi-media exhibition of images of the moon, sun, planets, and stars made by artists since the nineteenth century. Artistic observation of the skies was advanced by the dawn of photography in 1839, when Louis-Jacques-Mand&#233; Daguerre attempted to capture an image of the moon, and in 1865 when Lewis Rutherfurd, inventor of the first telescope designed for astrophotography, made top-quality spectroscopic images of the moon. Since then, artists&#8217; enthusiasm for recording and interpreting the grandeur and mystery of the cosmos has not waned. The exhibition comprises historical works from the Art Center&#8217;s collection as well as several more contemporary works on loan; artists include Vija Celmins, Chris McCaw, Sharon Harper, David Milan, Mungo Thomson, Lisa Oppenheim, and Trevor Paglen. Support for the exhibition is provided by the Evelyn Metzger Exhibition Fund.</p>

<p class="Module__desc__paragraph">In spring 2016, the Art Center will host Mark Dion as Vassar artist-in-residence. Dion is a New York and Pennsylvania-based visual artist known for his &#8220;cabinets of curiosities&#8221; that incorporate found objects into site-specific installations. Dion will co-teach a course with anthropology professor Anne Pike-Tay, culminating in a work comprised of items drawn from the collections of the Art Center, Special Collections, and Vassar College Artifacts Project. This wealth of resources includes materials as diverse as nineteenth-century scientific instruments, Native American objects, Vassariana, examples of taxidermy, sculpture, geological specimens, and antique books. Dion writes, &#8220;For me it is always a personal pleasure treasure hunting for projects. Certainly we will uncover things never suspected.&#8221;&#160;The exhibition is generously supported by the Creative Arts Across Disciplines initiative of Vassar College, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation;&#160;the Ralph E. Ogden Foundation; and the Friends of the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center Exhibition Fund. Additional support provided by the New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA).</p>
